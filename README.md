# PLAYING WITH NODE #

This is just a small web app I'm building using Node.js. I mainly wanted to just play around with the whole MEAN stack so this repo is my little playground for that. I'm using a lot of cool new stuff like npm, express, flightman, hogan.js, nodemon, less (not really using it yet), mongodb (eventually), etc. I'm planning to create a small REST api. Maybe I'll have a small user system that I'll maintain within a mongodb database. :fire: :fire: :fire: :fire: :fire:
